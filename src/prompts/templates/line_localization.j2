I have access to a python code repository in the directory {{ instance.repo_path }}.

You will be provided with an issue description and you will need to act as a code search agent to find the relevant lines in the code files where we need to make changes so that the issue is resolved.
NOTE: You do not need to solve the issue, all you need to do is find the relevant lines of code. Your output will be used to guide another agent to solve the issue.
Only use grep to find and please output your answer as just a list of the relevant lines in the code files that are directly related to the issue description in the format <answer>[(file1, (start_line, end_line)), (file2, (start_line, end_line)), (file2, (start_line, end_line)), ...]</answer> using the message parameter of the line_result tool.


Issue description:
