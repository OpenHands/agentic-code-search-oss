I have access to a python code repository in the directory {{ instance.repo_path }}. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_description>

Act as a code search agent and localize the specific files, classes or functions of code that need modification to resolve the issue in <issue_description>.

NOTE: You do not need to solve the issue, all you need to do is localize relevant code from the repository. Your output will be used to guide another agent to solve the issue.

Your final output should list the locations requiring modification, wrapped with triple backticks ```.

Since the expectation is to narrow down the exact functions and their locations, you must make sure to use available tools to thoroughly search and read files over multiple turns before generating the final output.

Now localize the code that needs to be modified to fix the issue described above.
